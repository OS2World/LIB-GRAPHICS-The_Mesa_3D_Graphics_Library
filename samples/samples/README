WarpMesaGL vers. alpha minus 1.47

Port to OS/2 PM of Mesa by Brian Paul (www.mesa3d.org)
Mesa is a 3-D multyplatform graphics library with an API which is
very similar to that of OpenGL. 

"WarpMesaGL" is current work name for port of original Mesa.
The name "Mesa" in OS/2 is currently used for electronic table, 
so "WarpMesaGL" is used to eliminate misunderstanding. 

Original Mesa version: 5.1 (c) Brian Paul
